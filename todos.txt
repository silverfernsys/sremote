So what are my todos?
==================================================================================
HTTP endpoint to list processes.
HTTP endpoint to start/shutdown/restart process.
HTTP endpoint to retrieve memory usage stats for group:name.
==================================================================================
Websocket api endpoint to retrieve memory usage stats.
Websocket api endpoint to update process status.
==================================================================================
What should I do when the user changes group and / or name of running application?
At this point, keep the data around for renamed processes. Don't worry about the
extra space used up or renaming processes to get historical data. If the user
renames their process, the data just gets lost. There should also be a csv data
dump option.

Config file options:
INCLUDE_SELF=False		# Include SupervisorController in the list of running apps.
						# managed by supervisor (iff supervisor is responsible for 
						# running the application).
TICK=60					# How often to take a memory snapshot (in seconds).
DATA_AGE=30				# How long to retain data in Whisper database. Age is in days.
DUMP_DATA=True			# Dump data after it reaches a certain age. 
DATA_FORMAT=csv			# Dump data to a comma separated values text file. Other formats?
						# Perhaps other format could be Whisper? So once the database fills
						# up, it's copied into the data directory.


$CWD/remotectrl.conf
$CWD/etc/remotectrl.conf
/etc/remotectrl/remotectrl.conf

Create sample supervisord and ngnix files for running and hosting the application.
